# Project blog
In this project, I will build a personal blog which has two modes, administration mode and user mode. In order to finish this project finally, I separate the project as several parts and finishing them step by step. So let's do it. 


## first-part: User mode basic operation
In this part, I will finish the basic user operation, such as signing in, signing out, signing up and change password. What's more, I will finish writing and showing articles. It will take at most 4 days since now.
